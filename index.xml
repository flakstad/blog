the job. Notion, Asana, Trello, Jira, ..all powerful, but also bloated,
complicated, and designed around the mouse. Basecamp is a nice breath of fresh
air with it&amp;rsquo;s relative simplicity and focus on communication, but still falls
short of the fluid keyboard-driven workflow I’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I kept coming back to my old favorite: Emacs org-mode. Org has
everything I love: hierarchical outlines, flexible todos, notes, deadlines, and
lightning-fast keyboard navigation. The problem is, it’s not built for teams.
Nobody else can easily see your progress. You end up either isolated in your org
files or forced back into the big, bloated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want is simple: the speed and focus of org-mode combined with the
visibility and integration of a web app. None of the existing tools strike this
balance, so I’ve started building my own. The long-term vision is a complete
project management tool shaped by these principles, but the first step is
modest: an outline component for the web, inspired by org-mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Creator’s Oath</title><link>https://andreasflakstad.no/posts/creatorsoath/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://andreasflakstad.no/posts/creatorsoath/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A manifesto for principled software builders who honor craft, integrity, and the user’s freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a manifesto for creators who refuse to build noise. It is an
oath to create only what is worthy. For ourselves. For those who value
their time. For a world that deserves better tools. To build software
that empower users, respect their freedom, and endures beyond fleeting
trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
