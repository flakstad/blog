  <h1 class="post-title">Org-mode Style Outlines for the Web</h1>

  
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Emacs org-mode&rsquo;s powerful outline functionality. My favorite features - hierarchical todos, metadata like due dates and priorities, and keyboard-driven navigation - have made it my go-to tool for task management. But what if you could have that same power in your web applications?</p>
<p>The web is full of todo apps, but they all miss the mark. Simple checkboxes lack the power I need, while full project management tools overwhelm with features I don&rsquo;t want. I wanted the keyboard-driven efficiency of org-mode, but built for the web - accessible, integrable, and focused on what matters.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an attempt to solve it - a modern web component that brings my favorite org-mode features to the web, with some adjustments:</p>
<script src="/js/clarity-outline.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/clarity-outline.css">

<div class="clarity-outline-demo">
  <clarity-outline 
    data-items='[
      {"id":"1","text":"Buy milk","status":"TODO"},
      {"id":"2","text":"Take out the trash","status":"IN PROGRESS"},
      {"id":"3","text":"Call mom","status":"DONE"},
      {"id":"4","text":"Read email","status":"TODO"},
      {"id":"5","text":"Fix the broken lamp","status":"CANCELLED"},
      {"id":"6","text":"Write blog post","status":"IN PROGRESS"}
    ]'
    options='{"statusLabels": [{"label": "TODO", "isEndState": false}, {"label": "IN PROGRESS", "isEndState": false}, {"label": "DONE", "isEndState": true}, {"label": "CANCELLED", "isEndState": true}]}'>
  </clarity-outline>
</div>

<p>The component is designed for keyboard-first interaction. You can navigate with Tab as usual, but also use arrow keys to move between items. Alt+arrow keys let you indent/outdent items, and Alt+Tab toggles collapse/expand. While it&rsquo;s optimized for keyboard use, it also supports mouse interactions - hover over items to see available actions with keyboard shortcut hints.</p>
<p>Notable features include priority marking (simplified from org-mode&rsquo;s A,B,C system - something is either priority or it&rsquo;s not), on-hold status (inspired by Basecamp&rsquo;s card tables as a separate state that can occur on any other status), assignment for collaboration (not possible in org-mode), custom status labels, event-driven integration, and built-in theming support.</p>
<p>The outline emits events for every interaction, designed to integrate with larger systems. You can&rsquo;t delete items here or add rich descriptions and comments - I intend to handle those on dedicated pages per outline item. This component focuses on the core outline functionality and navigation.</p>
<p>This is a start, a work in progress. The component supports keyboard navigation, custom status labels, and event-driven integration. You can find the source code and contribute at <a href="https://github.com/andreasflakstad/clarity-outline">github.com/andreasflakstad/clarity-outline</a>.</p>
