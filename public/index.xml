      <description>&lt;p&gt;For as long as I’ve had to manage projects, I’ve disliked the tools built for the job.&#xA;Notion, Asana, Trello, Jira, ..all powerful, but also bloated, complicated, and designed around the mouse. Basecamp is a nice breath of fresh air with it&amp;rsquo;s relative simplicity and focus on communication, but still falls short of the fluid keyboard-driven workflow I’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I kept coming back to my old favorite: Emacs org-mode.&#xA;Org has everything I love: hierarchical outlines, flexible todos, notes, deadlines, and lightning-fast keyboard navigation. The problem is, it’s not built for teams. Nobody else can easily see your progress. You end up either isolated in your org files or forced back into the big, bloated tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I really want is simple: the speed and focus of org-mode combined with the visibility and integration of a web app. None of the existing tools get this balance right, so I’ve started building my own. The long-term vision is a full project management tool shaped by these principles, but the first step is small: an outline component for the web, inspired by org-mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A manifesto for principled software builders who honor craft, integrity, and the user’s freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a manifesto for creators who refuse to build noise. It is an&#xA;oath to create only what is worthy. For ourselves. For those who value&#xA;their time. For a world that deserves better tools. To build software&#xA;that empower users, respect their freedom, and endures beyond fleeting&#xA;trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
