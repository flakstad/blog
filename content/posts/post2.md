One day, I got a chance. It just seemed to show up. It acted like it knew me, as if it wanted something.

This is how Kobi Yamada's book What do you do with a chance? starts. I've been reading that beautiful book to the boys at bedtime since it came out in 2018. It continues:

It fluttered around me. It brushed up against me. It circled me as if it wanted me to grab it.

What a mesmerizing mental image of a chance, fluttering about.

What do you do with a chance? is a great book exactly because it's not just for the boys, but for me too. A poetic reminder of what being open to chance looks like, and what to do when it shows up.

Right now, Omarchy feels like that chance. Like Linux fluttered into my hands and said "let's take a trip to the moon".

I joked on X that perhaps it was the new creatine routine I picked up from Pieter Levels, but I only started that a few days ago, so I really do think it's actually Linux!

This exhilaration of The Chance reminds me of the 1986 cult classic Highlander. There's a fantastic montage in the middle where Sean Connery is teaching Christopher Lambert to fight for the prize of immortality, and in it, he talks about The Quickening. Feeling the stag, feeling the opportunity.

That's the feeling I have when I wake up in the morning at the moment: The Quickening. There's something so exciting here, so energizing, that I simply must get to the keyboard and chase wherever it flutters to.
